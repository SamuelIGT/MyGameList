## Description
My Game List is an app that aims to discover and organize games from the Steam platform that is in the user's interest, providing new findings and experiences in the game universe.

When it starts, the application will send a request to a **REST API** to get a list of random games of the Steam platform. When the user hit the like button on a game, this data will be stored locally on the device as well as in a cloud database.

The app is still in development and soon will be released.
